Timezone
--------

recv-time-zone() sets the assumed timezone of a message that does not carry a tz offset.
recv-time-zone() doesn't do anything if timezone is already set
time-zone() converts the whole timestamp to the time-zone specified within time-zone()
time-zone() is a per source / destination override. can only convert if time-zone is
specified. if recv-time-zone() is not specified than default = localtime
send-time-zone() also changes the time-zone but is overriden by time-zone() if set

Conclusion
----------

recv-time-zone() only sets tz offset to a message that does not carray tz offset.
send-time-zone(x) converts the timestamp to the time at offset x
time-zone(x) converts the timestamp to the timat at offset x (overrides send-time-zone(x)).
time-zone(x) specified in destination overrides global time-zone(x).

if keep-timestamp(yes) then still the message is changed (admin guide wrong?!)

send-time-zone and time-zone both change timestamp. both are not interfering with
recv-time-zone. if recv-time-zone is not set local timezone is used.
